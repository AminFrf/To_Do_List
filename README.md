# 📝 To-Do List Manager (Python OOP + CSV)

This project is a simple **To-Do List Manager** built using **Python**, demonstrating key programming concepts such as **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, **CSV file handling**, and **basic data management**.

---

## 🚀 Features

* **Add Task** – Add a new task with a name, description, and priority.
* **Remove Task** – Delete a task from the list.
* **View Tasks** – Display all tasks currently in the list.
* **Save to CSV** – Automatically save all tasks to a CSV file.
* **Load from CSV** – Load tasks from a CSV file on startup.
* **Set Task Priority** – Assign priorities like *High*, *Medium*, or *Low* to each task.

## 🧠 Project Structure

### ✅ `Task` Class

Represents a single task with:

* Name
* Description
* Priority

### ✅ `ToDoList` Class

Manages a list of tasks with methods to:

* Add tasks
* Remove tasks
* View all tasks
* Save/load tasks to/from a CSV file

---

## 📋 How It Works

The program uses a simple **text-based menu** to let users:

1. Add a task
2. Remove a task
3. View tasks
4. Save or load task list

All data is persisted using **CSV files**, so your tasks are saved between runs.

## 🛠 Requirements

* Python 3.x
  (No external libraries required)
